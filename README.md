# WiiEmulator

## Overview
Welcome to my Wii Emulator project that I'm working on over Summer 2024! I aim to be making a userfriendly emulator for the Wii allowing for people to play childhood wii games on their laptops. This README file will guide you through the installation process, features, usage, and contribution guidelines for the project.
